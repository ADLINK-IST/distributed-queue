# Distributed Eventual Queue for Vortex
In many situations (at least those we can imagine right now) such an distributed-eventual-queue is used in a 'worker-pattern' where you can load-balance the work around multiple queue-readers.
Rather than load-balancing on individual samples, this version load-balances over instances (assuming that samples of an instance form a 'work-package').
